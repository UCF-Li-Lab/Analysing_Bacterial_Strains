(1) First of all, you need to install the simulation tool----dwgsim
Link:  https://github.com/nh13/DWGSIM

(2) The code is run in the python2.7

You need to install python (recommend: python 2.7.x-64bit), which is already installed by default for most of current Linux systems. If there is no python 2.7 installed, you can download and install python from (http://www.python.org/download/). You can use "python -V" command to check whether python is installed and the version of Python.

(3) You need to modify the path of each file based on your location computer.

For example:

'/dwgsim/simulated_data_with_evolutionary_relationship/data/original_genome/' ------> 'Your own path/original_genome/'
